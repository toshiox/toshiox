# Hello, I'm Gustavo Toshio! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you will find personal projects that I develop in my free time and repositories of test cases that I use as examples on my blog. I am a software developer with over 8 years of experience in areas such as retail, healthcare, finance and digital banking. I am passionate about learning and applying new technologies to solve complex problems. I like working with numbers, statistics and performance.
